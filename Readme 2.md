# [Hackathon of Talent Squad II (Barcelona- September 2022)](https://nuwe.io/dev/challenges/talent-squad-data-science-ii)

## Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is to classify images into three categories. All images are from 3 different sports the status of a rocket by studing the info collected by six sensors. The initial data set included a label of status column and six numeric columns according to the values of each sensor. Test data set only included the values of the six sensors.
This project was the challenge of the hackathon Talent Squad, which ultimately aims to select best candidates for future job proposals on the data field.

## Methodology

1. Inferential Statistics.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Screening classification by machine Learning.
4. Tunning of hyperparameters to optimize the chosen model.
5. Predict the status for the test data set (supplied without label) with the optimised model.

## Tools

* Python
* Git & Github
* Jupyter Notebook
* Visual Studio Code
* Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Pycaret, Optuna. (Keras from Tensorflow was used for some unsuccesful trials, if you are curious you can check the [notebook with trials](https://github.com/MarkusHumetus/Hackathon_Talent_Squad/blob/main/main_NN.ipynb))

## Getting Started

1. Clone this [repo](https://github.com/MarkusHumetus/Hackathon_Talent_Squad.git) (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Use requirements.txt to install all required dependencies. Please note that Pycaret 2.3.0 only works properly under Python 3.6-3.8

## Project Status

[Finished]

Project was completed and submitted for competition in 26th of June 2022.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the following organisations for the set up of such event which give the junior data scientist oportunities to learn, do networking and hopefully reach a first job in the data field.
