# [Hackathon of Talent Squad II (Barcelona- September 2022)](https://nuwe.io/dev/challenges/talent-squad-data-science-ii)

## Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is to classify images into three categories/sports: baseball, cricket or football. A small set of images are provided (221) and there is two main targets :

1. Increased the training samples in the training set
2. Calculate the score macro F1 of the predictions.

This project was the challenge of the hackathon Talent Squad II, which ultimately aims to select best candidates for future job proposals on the data field.

## Methodology

1 -> Check initial images and to homogenize image formats.

2 -> Wep scrapping of new images for each sport to increase the training set.

3 -> Validate new images: content and size.

4 -> Split images to 3 squared images with no aspect ratio distortion.

5 -> Generation of arrays with images at the proper size and lists with labelling (testing/validation array included) 

6 -> Create different Convolutional Neural Network/CNN: the simplest one, with augmented images, adding an initial pretained model. 

7- > Training and validation 
save models

8 -> Prediction with the best CNN
    Final predictions
    - Image distorted
    - squared images average
    - squared img maximum

9 -> Save predictions 

10 - > generate the requirements. txt

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the following organisations for the set up of such event which give the junior data scientist oportunities to learn, do networking and hopefully reach a first job in the data field.
